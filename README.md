# genome-transformer

Apply the [Sub-Linear Memory Performer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11346.pdf) to genome sequences and see what happens.

## Background

What are transformers? This section describes the technology from a highly abstracted perspective.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Fetch pretraining data: genomes
- [ ] Make tokenizer and tokenize gene sequences
- [ ] Pretrain SLiM Performer
- [ ] Release pretrained model weights
